### Description

This project demonstrates database manipulation through ADO. It is a complete application in itself. Thanks and credit goes to LaVolpe for his magnificent buttons that I used in the project. This is my first submission to this great site and I hope you could learn something from it. Please give your comments and suggestions so that I could improve it and hopefully upload a version 2 of this project. If its not too much to ask, PLEASE do vote so that I'd know where my learning status stands. Thanks and God bless.

***NOTE For those of you who downloaded the code from March 19 - 20, 2004: Please redownload the code. I reuploaded it fixing the bugs during initialization. Thanks and God Bless.
 
### More Info
 
Database Password is "crimson119".
